We shouldn't pick favorites, but this is definitely one of our favorite episodes so far. We have the extreme pleasure of learning from Brandon Goodell, Research Associate at Monero Research Lab, about Monero, how it's designed, privacy in Monero and how it compares to other coins like ZCash, scalability, and consensus mechanisms in general. This is exactly the kinda conversations we built this show for, and there were more than one eye opening moments. Definitely scope this one out!
