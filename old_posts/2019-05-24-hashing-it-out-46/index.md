We have CTO of Ren, Loong Wang, on to educate us on their token transfer protocol. Ren is building a system that allows a user to transfer a token from one change to another, without the drawbacks found in techniques like atomic swaps. They have a network of "dark nodes" which run on their virtual machine, RenVM, to computer across the transactions and share data over the network. Interesting technology with many use cases!
