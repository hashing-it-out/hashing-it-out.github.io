Episode 01 - April 03, 2018 â€” 57 mins 
**Guests: Nick Johnson**

Nick Johnson of the Ethereum Foundation talks about the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). ENS is bringing human-understandable naming to address resources both on-chain and off-chain. Nick is incorporating a new non-profit organization to support the efforts to build out a decentralized system for creating and managing these names. In addition, we pull from his expertise as go-ethereum engineer to get his take on dapp usability, solidity language quirks, blockchain scaling, and our blockchain-driven future.
