 Episode 27 October 18, 2018 â€” 63 mins - **Guests: Dr. E. Glen Weyl**

Blockchain hipsters, we have a treat: Dr. Weyl, co-author of Radical Markets. His book quickly became a popular with us in decentralization. The book proposes new ways to create marketplaces to provide better opportunities for optimal redistribution of resources. This has especially strong implications for those designing decentralized systems and applications. We talk with him about his book, the motivations behind radical markets, and potential futures involving his schemes.
