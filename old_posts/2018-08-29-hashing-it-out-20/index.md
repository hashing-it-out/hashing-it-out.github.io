In this episode, we interview Kacper Bak, Research Engineer at Quanstamp. Quantstamp has created a system for auditing smart contracts automatically, testing for known exploits. They verify the more common attack vectors, and provide a report to the user about the potential threat. We go into how their product is built, the future of their product, and how it can benefit and drive future innovation.
