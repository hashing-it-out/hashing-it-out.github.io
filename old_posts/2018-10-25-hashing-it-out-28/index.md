 Episode 28 October 25, 2018 â€” 59 mins - **Guests: Niran Babalola**

So you have a decentralize app you want to use... how do you know its smart contracts are safe? That's where Panvala comes in! Using their system you can certify the security and authenticity of your smart contracts and obtain a mark in proof of this certification. On this episode we talk with its co-founder, Niran Babalola, about their smart contract registry and certification system. We learn of its process, development, and larger implications. We learn what it takes to get from zero to one in a project that requires community participation to improve the certification process.
