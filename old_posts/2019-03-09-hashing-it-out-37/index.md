Managing crypto keys is difficult enough for private holders, but when managing large portfolios of cryptocurrency assets on an institutional level, the risk surface increases tremendously. Base Zero has devised a suite of tools to manage multi-signature signing over an air-gapped signing device and a sharded backup system to ensure security for large organizations. This unique approach enables these institutions to mitigate risk associated with large fund transfers without any one single person being able to compromise the system and with highly secured disaster recovery.
