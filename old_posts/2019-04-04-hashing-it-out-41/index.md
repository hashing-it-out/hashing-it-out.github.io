Ahoy-hoy! Today we have Director of Security at MyCrypto, Harry Denley. We talk about phishing attacks! No, not assaults at jam band concerts, the kind where you lose your money. We go over the process of finding these attacks, reacting to them, and staying ahead of the scammers. We talk about the tools used to intercept and analyze these attacks, and the processes surrounding gathering the evidence against the attackers. Harry is doing amazing work, and he's really putting effort into keeping us all safe. Thanks, Harry!
