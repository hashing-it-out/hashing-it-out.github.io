MakerDAO has built a token that is reasonably stable with the USD. We have the great pleasure of interviewing Nik Kunkel, Head of Backend Services at Maker. In this Part 2 of 2 on Maker, we talk about the technical design behind developing Maker. Please listen to Part 1 of 2 (previous episode, #47) before this, as it's essential for understanding the principles guiding the design decisions. This is compelling work, and truly amazing how well it's standing against the throes of the fluctuating markets.
