With great pleasure, we present to you, Austin Griffith. You've seen this man all over YouTube, often rockin' a bowtie, and showing some amazing and dynamic live demonstrations of his creative process in designing new user experiences for Ethereum. Author of the xDAI burner wallet, expert in meta transactions, and dapp development pioneer, Austin's energy and knowledge is palpable. This episode is a lot of fun and highly educational.
