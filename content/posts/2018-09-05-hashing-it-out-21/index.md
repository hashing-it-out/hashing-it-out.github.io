\[one\_half\]Episode 21\[/one\_half\]\[one\_half\_last\]September 05, 2018 â€” 70 mins\[/one\_half\_last\] **Guests: Bernhard Mueller**

The famous Bernhard Mueller joined us today to talk about the fantastic work being done to beef up his already amazing tool, Mythril. The new Mythril platform beefs up the symbolic analyzer as well as adding static analysis tools and linters (Maru), a dynamic analyzer and input fuzzer (Harvey) and an API for easy integration into a developer's processes. We dive into what brought Bernhard to write Mythril and how it's taken off as a premier auditing tool. We also get into the future of security tools and how the processes being developed today will inform best practices of the future.
