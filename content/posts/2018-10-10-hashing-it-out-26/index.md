 Episode 26 October 10, 2018 â€” 59 mins - **Guests: Michael Egorov & John Pacific**

Great Caesar's Ghost! NuCypher has demo'd a practical fully-homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme that leverages an Ethereum smart contract for a proof mechanism. We get to go over FHE: what it is, how it works, how it commits to the blockchain, scaling issues, and the future of encrypted computation. This will enable new privacy mechanisms on layer 2 solutions which interface with the blockchain cheaply and efficiently. Very big stuff for anyone trying to use blockchain as a resolution mechanism but wants to hide their business rules in the process!
