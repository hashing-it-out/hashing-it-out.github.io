TrueBit is one of the more impressive decentralized projects, and we're really excited to have had the chance to interview Harley Swick, core developer on the project. We talk to him about TrueBit, how it works, it's significance, how it differentiates itself from other off-chain computation projects. We go over some of the many, many applications of decentralized off-chain computation projects and how they can improve world resource utilization. Amazing and really exciting stuff!
