\[one\_half\]Episode 29\[/one\_half\]\[one\_half\_last\]November 13, 2018 â€” 59 mins\[/one\_half\_last\] **Guests: Alex van de Sande**

Alex va de Sande is a UX designer and developer for the Ethereum foundation who has come up with a new, clean way to provide universal login capability to any decentralized application. Using a combination of standards such as ERC725 identity contracts and his proposed ERC1077 and ERC1078, he has created a way to login across any application using a single login mechanism. We go over his system, his views on the challenges behind adoption that UX can solve, and the future of DApps as they begin implementing standards such as universal logins.
