MakerDAO has built a token that is reasonably stable with the USD. We have the great pleasure of interviewing Nik Kunkel, Head of Backend Services at Maker. In this Part 1 of 2 on Maker, we talk about the cryptoeconomics behind creating a stable token pegged to the USD. It's essential to understand this before getting into the technicals found in Part 2 of 2 (next episode, #48). This is compelling work, and truly amazing how well it's standing against the throes of the fluctuating markets.
