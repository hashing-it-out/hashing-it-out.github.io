**Guests: Orie Steele**

Orie Steele, CTO of Transmute Industries. Orie is the creator of the Transmute Platform, a rapid application development framework for centralized, decentralized, and hybrid Ethereum applications and services. We discuss language features of Solidity, scalability paradigms such as Truebit, building blockchain architectures, and off-chain scalability. We pull from his cyber security training to talk about security and best practices in smart contract development to get his take on dapp usability, solidity language quirks, blockchain scaling, and our blockchain-driven future.
