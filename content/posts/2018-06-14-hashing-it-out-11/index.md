In this episode, we dive into NuCypher. NuCypher is an encryption library for managing key access on decentralized networks. We talk about proxy re-encryption, how access is granted, and the creation of their node network. We also discuss the topic of fully homomorphic encryption and the role of privacy in future decentralized applications.
