 Episode 03 - April 17, 2018 â€” 58 mins - **Guests: Fabian Vogelsteller**

Fabian Vogelsteller, creator of the Mist wallet, Web3.js, the history of the ERC20 Token standard, and his ERC725 Identity proposal. He speaks to us about his new industry effort, Lukso ([https://www.lukso.io/](https://www.lukso.io/)), which marries blockchain to luxury goods supply chain solutions. He speaks to us about adoption, data governance, industry network effects, and how to bring enterprises to blockchain. We get into his thoughts on standardization to build open communication protocols for building bridges between collaborators, regulators, and end consumers to ensure data integrity. We speak to him about the impact of the ERC20 standard proposal and how it has fostered a $6 billion ecosystem.
