\[one\_half\]Episode 19\[/one\_half\]\[one\_half\_last\]August 22, 2018 â€” 70 mins\[/one\_half\_last\] **Guests: Kevin Owocki**

We talk with Kevin Owocki, co-founder of Gitcoin. No joke, this episode is compelling. Gitcoin is a decentralized application which incentives open source contributors with bounties for bugs and features. Kevin tells us about the creation of Gitcoin, how their incentive models work, their architecture, and their alternate funding mechanism for open source projects, CodeFund. We then take a trip to Jupiter and dream of the future of decentralization, theorycrafting what that world will look like and what we need to build to get there. Exciting topics!
