Will O'Beirne of MyCrypto talks with us about front end dapp development, conveying trust to your end-user on trustless networks, deployment methodology for decentralized systems, and what it takes to build a product in this early stage of blockchain development. We also go over some of the project libraries and tools used in creating MyCrypto. It's a compelling take on how UX design can inform product growth.
