 Episode 34 December 19, 2018 â€” 77 mins - **Guests: Shawn Wilkinson & JT Olio**

File storage has long been known as a centralized solution. Storj seeks to change this with their decentralized file storage and retrieval architecture. We'll go over their design, engineering goals, and challenges. We dive deep into how erasure codes can be used to mitigate replication requirements, how trust is managed on their decentralized platform, and how one can be incentivized to donate their storage space and bandwidth to the world through their network.
